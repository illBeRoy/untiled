## General
***untiled*** is a small, to point tilemap editor. It's a pet project I started in order to easily create maps to work with in my games, where I don't need many features so keeping stuff simple was top priority.

This is not a perfect software, though - far from it. That's why feedback \ contributions would be much appreciated, so this software can be as convenient and as fun to use as possible.

## Features
* üó∫ Create tile-based maps from png/jpg tilesets
* üíæ Save \ load documents using a standalone JSON format
* üñº Export maps to PNG
* ‚úèÔ∏è Frame drawing mode: select a 3x3 tiles group to draw framed areas
* ‚Ü© Undo
