## General
***untiled*** is a small, to point tilemap editor. It's a pet project I started in order to easily create maps to work with in my games, where I don't need many features so keeping stuff simple was top priority.

This is not a perfect software, though - far from it. That's why feedback \ contributions would be much appreciated, so this software can be as convenient and as fun to use as possible.

## Features
* üó∫ Create tile-based maps from png/jpg tilesets
* üíæ Save \ load documents using a standalone JSON format
* üñº Export maps to PNG
* ‚úèÔ∏è Frame drawing mode: select a 3x3 tiles group to draw framed areas
* ‚Ü© Undo

## Download
You can find downloadables in the [releases page](https://github.com/illBeRoy/untiled/releases).

## Development
If you wish to work on the project locally, make sure that you have a supported node version (LTS or later).

Start by pulling this project using:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:illBeRoy/untiled.git
```

Then install dependencies using:
```bash
npm install
```

You can now either run the project in your browser, using:
```bash
npm start
```

Or run it as standalone executable using:
```bash
npm run start:nwjs
```

If you want to build an executable use the following command:
```bash
npm run build:target:desktop
```
Currently it will only build to mac, but with minor modifications you'll be able to build for other platforms as well.
